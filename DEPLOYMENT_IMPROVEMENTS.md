# Hugo Deployment Optimization Summary

## Overview

This PR optimizes the deployment process for this Hugo static blog by implementing industry best practices and leveraging GitHub Actions' native capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Eliminate Build Artifacts from Repository ✅

**Before**: 6.5MB of generated HTML/CSS/JS (203 files) committed to git
**After**: Build artifacts generated on-demand during deployment

**Impact**:
- Faster git operations (clone, pull, fetch)
- Cleaner repository focused on source code
- Better git history without generated file noise
- Reduced repository size

### 2. Automated Deployment Pipeline ✅

**Before**: No deployment workflow; relied on manual GitHub Pages configuration
**After**: Automated deployment via GitHub Actions

**Impact**:
- Push to main → automatic deployment
- No manual intervention required
- Consistent, repeatable deployments
- Built-in rollback capabilities via git

### 3. Separation of Concerns ✅

**Before**: Single workflow tried to do everything (build, test, commit, push)
**After**: Two focused workflows:

- **PR Workflow** (`build-site.yaml`): Validates builds and runs quality checks
- **Deploy Workflow** (`deploy.yaml`): Handles production deployments

**Impact**:
- Clearer CI/CD pipeline
- Faster PR feedback
- No more force-pushing to PR branches
- Better security (PRs can't deploy)

### 4. Latest Hugo Version ✅

**Before**: Fixed at Hugo v0.151.0
**After**: Always uses latest stable Hugo release

**Impact**:
- Access to latest features and improvements
- Security patches automatically applied
- Better performance with each Hugo release

### 5. Optimized GitHub Actions ✅

**Before**: Basic workflow with no optimization
**After**: Leverages official GitHub Actions and best practices

**Improvements**:
- Uses `actions/checkout@v4` (latest)
- Uses `actions/configure-pages@v5` for Pages integration
- Uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` for deployment
- Uses `actions/deploy-pages@v4` for publishing
- Proper permissions and concurrency control

### 6. Updated Quality Checks ✅

**Before**: Lighthouse CI v11.4.0
**After**: Lighthouse CI v12.6.1

**Impact**:
- Latest performance and accessibility checks
- Better reporting and insights

## Configuration Changes

### Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`** (NEW)
   - Production deployment workflow
   - Triggered on push to main
   - Uses GitHub Pages deployment action

2. **`.github/workflows/build-site.yaml`** (UPDATED)
   - Renamed from "build-site" to "Build and Test PR"
   - Removed git push logic
   - Updated to latest actions
   - Cleaner, focused workflow

3. **`config.toml`** (UPDATED)
   - Removed `publishDir = "docs"`
   - Now uses Hugo default `public/` directory

4. **`.gitignore`** (UPDATED)
   - Added `docs` to ignore list
   - Added `resources/_gen/` for Hugo cache

5. **`lighthouserc.json`** (UPDATED)
   - Changed `staticDistDir` from `./docs` to `./public`

6. **`README.md`** (UPDATED)
   - Documented new deployment process
   - Updated build instructions

7. **`DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATION.md`** (NEW)
   - Step-by-step migration guide
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Post-Merge Steps Required

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions for Pages (REQUIRED)

In the repository settings:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under "Build and deployment" → "Source", select **GitHub Actions**
3. Save the changes

⚠️ **This is required for the new deployment to work!**

### 2. Clean Up docs/ Folder (OPTIONAL)

After verifying the new workflow works:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git rm -r docs/
git commit -m "Remove docs/ folder - now deployed via GitHub Actions"
git push origin main
```

This will remove the 6.5MB of build artifacts from the main branch.

## Verification Checklist

After merging this PR:

- [ ] GitHub Pages set to deploy from GitHub Actions
- [ ] Push to main triggers deployment workflow
- [ ] Site deploys successfully to https://nathankuik.com/
- [ ] Custom domain still works correctly
- [ ] PR workflow runs and validates builds
- [ ] Lighthouse CI reports on PRs

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. In GitHub Settings → Pages, change source back to "Deploy from a branch"
2. Select `main` branch and `/docs` folder
3. Revert this PR's changes
4. The old workflow will work as before

## Additional Optimizations (Future Enhancements)

These optimizations were not included to keep changes minimal, but could be added later:

1. **Caching**: Add Hugo module/resource caching for faster builds
2. **Matrix builds**: Test on multiple Hugo versions
3. **Preview deployments**: Deploy PR previews to separate URLs
4. **CDN optimization**: Add CloudFlare or other CDN optimizations
5. **Image optimization**: Automated image compression
6. **Asset fingerprinting**: Better cache control for assets
