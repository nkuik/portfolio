      <description>&lt;p&gt;I currently work at The LEGO Group, and one of the amazing things we get to do is something called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lego.com/en-us/careers/stories/fabulab&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fabulab&lt;/a&gt;. Fabulab is a program that allows employees to take time out of their regular work to focus on innovative projects that can benefit the company and its products. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic opportunity to explore new ideas, collaborate with colleagues from different departments, and contribute to the company&amp;rsquo;s innovation culture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All posts in this category are related to my experiences and projects within the Fabulab program at The LEGO Group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
