      <description>API Gateway V1 (REST) vs. V2 (Websocket and HTTP) I was setting up a Lambda Function that sat behind a specific route of an API Gateway the other day at work, instead of setting up a microservice on a Kubernetes cluster and dealing with the ingress/deployment setup. While I was able to find specific parts of this setup out there on the interwebs, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find an end-to-end solution that just worked &amp;ldquo;out of the box.</description>

      <description>A Single Server Let’s imagine a small server running an application out in the wild. The application is small&amp;ndash;it requires only a backend server, a database, and some static frontend code&amp;ndash;but despite its size, the traffic on this server has been increasing in the last few weeks.
As the traffic continues to grow, response times grow slower and users begin complaining about the application’s slowness. Thankful that the application is seeing increased traffic, the main developer of the application uses a late night to increase CPU and memory on the server (a vertical scale), which succeeds without issue.</description>

      <description>On June 16, I was fortunate enough to give my first conference workshop, entitled &amp;ldquo;Going with the Flow: Increasing Mindfulness and Flow Experiences to Fight Burnout and Depression&amp;rdquo; at Wordcamp Europe. I gave the workshop in partnership with Open Sourcing Mental Illness, a non-profit working to raise awareness of mental health issues in the tech industry.
I created a repo with summarized information and resources, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to post a video when it becomes available.</description>
