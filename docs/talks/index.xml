      <description>On June 16, I was fortunate enough to give my first conference workshop, entitled &amp;ldquo;Going with the Flow: Increasing Mindfulness and Flow Experiences to Fight Burnout and Depression&amp;rdquo; at Wordcamp Europe. I gave the workshop in partnership with Open Sourcing Mental Illness, a non-profit working to raise awareness of mental health issues in the tech industry.
I created a repo with summarized information and resources, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to post a video when it becomes available.</description>
