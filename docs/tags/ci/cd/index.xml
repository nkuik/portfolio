my work last month. We had some compliance checks coming up, and instead of
making 2+ dev machines a part of the audit process, the decision was made to
fully automate the build and release process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some initial digging, I realized that there was a bit more to it
than I had first thought, primarily due to the fact that the current process
involved a designated individual from each team doing a manual clean build and
upload, using shared certificates and keys. While it was theoretically possible
that the compliance check could audit the existing process (e.g., dev machines),
it would be less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
