On June 16, I was fortunate enough to give my first conference workshop,
entitled ["Going with the Flow: Increasing Mindfulness and Flow Experiences to Fight Burnout and Depression"](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/going-with-the-flow-increasing-mindfulness-and-flow-experiences-to-fight-burnout-and-depression/) at [Wordcamp Europe](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/). I gave the workshop in partnership with [Open Sourcing Mental Illness](https://osmhhelp.org/), a non-profit working to raise awareness of mental health issues in the tech industry.

I [created a repo](https://github.com/nkuik/flow-resources) with summarized information and resources, and I'll be sure to post a video when it becomes available.
