I currently work at The LEGO Group, and one of the amazing things we get to do is something called [Fabulab](https://www.lego.com/en-us/careers/stories/fabulab). Fabulab is a program that allows employees to take time out of their regular work to focus on innovative projects that can benefit the company and its products. It's a fantastic opportunity to explore new ideas, collaborate with colleagues from different departments, and contribute to the company's innovation culture.

All posts in this catgegory are related to my experiences and projects within the Fabulab program at The LEGO Group.
