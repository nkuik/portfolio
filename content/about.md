# About

Hi. My name is Nathan, and I live in Copenhagen. I am clinical social worker turned developer, and I currently work at [Too Good To Go](https://toogoodtogo.com/en-us) as a DevOps engineer.

I use this site to collect some of my thoughts about a number of topics in the [blog](/posts/). I'm also happy to accept any kind of request or introduction via [email](mailto:nathan@nathankuik.com).
