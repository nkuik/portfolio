# About

Hi. My name is Nathan, and I live in Copenhagen, and I currently work at The LEGO Group as a Senior Engineer.

I use this site to collect some of my thoughts about a number of topics in the [blog](/posts/). If you're curious about my journey, I've written about [becoming a software developer](/posts/my-mandatory-junior-web-dev-post). I'm also happy to accept any kind of request or introduction via [email](mailto:me@nathankuik.com).

All thoughts and opinions shared here are mine alone.
